Hello everyone and welcome to the documentation of the Neurocognitive Psychology research project “Autism Spectrum disorder and Neuroanatomy”, conducted within the MSc5 course Computational Neuroscience at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main.

## ASD and Neuroanatomy

Within this course we will explore the cortical thickness differences in Autism Spectrum disorder when compared to the brains of Neurotypical individuals, and whether machine learning can predict which brain belongs in which category. An assessment of cortical thickness differences between the 2 biological sexes will also be undertaken. 

You can use the following sections to navigate through different aspects of this project:

* [Theoretical background and research question](https://gretivan.github.io/Neurocognitive_Psychology/general_information/literature.html)

   Why was this topic of interest chose and what is already known about it? What Datasets are out there to use?
    
* [Data- and Projectmanagement](https://gretivan.github.io/Neurocognitive_Psychology/general_information/datamanagement.html)

   How was the data aquired and organised? Where is everything documented? FAIR-ness?

* [Data Analysis](https://gretivan.github.io/Neurocognitive_Psychology/general_information/Data_analysis.html)

   How was the data downloaded, explored and analysed? Future directions?

   
* [Discussion and reflection](https://gretivan.github.io/Neurocognitive_Psychology/general_information/discussion.html)

   What does our analysis mean? Why could it be of importance? What are some limitations? What problems were faced? 

## Project vision

As part of the MSc5 research module, a presentation was held depicting what the ideas and plans are for the project. You can find the presentation held [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FXIgEsk5DZhZDtanG5q73QzMx1_c4PUtBNxw-5kaeY4/edit#slide=id.p), if you are interested in finding out more about the process of working through the ideas. 


## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Peer Herholz for his effort in creating this module for us and for providing so much new and valuable information and skill for us to learn, and for always being kind and helpful when it was needed no matter how big or small. A big thanks to Michael Ernst for giving so much informational input and providing in person sessions for useful exchanges, and to Maren Wehrheim for supervising and assisitng with the data analysis, and for providing new and innovative ways of applying machine learning methods.
